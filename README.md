# WaveEquationBox

Program that solves the wave equation on a box, given a suitable initial condition. 

The domain chosen is [0,1].

The discretization method is piecewise linear continuous functions.

The evolution is described via finite differences.

Attached are images showing an example solution, at different time steps, and stability and convergence of the energy.
