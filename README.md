# WaveEquationBox

Program that solves the wave equation on a box, given a suitable initial condition. 

The domain chosen is [0,1].

The discretization method is piecewise linear continuous functions.

The evolution is described via finite differences.

An example solution, at different time steps:

Stability of the Energy, for one particular solution, at different time steps:

Convergence of the energy, for t=10, at different resolutions:
